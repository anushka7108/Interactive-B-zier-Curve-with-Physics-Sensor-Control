# Interactive-B-zier-Curve-with-Physics-Sensor-Control
A visual demo of a cubic Bézier curve that bends and settles like a rope. The middle control points follow a spring-damping system for smooth motion, and tangent directions are drawn along the curve. Implemented entirely in HTML Canvas and vanilla JavaScript.
